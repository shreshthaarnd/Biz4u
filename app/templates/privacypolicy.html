        collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a
        conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and

       <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do
        Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your
        web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>
        <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your
        web browser.</p>

        inform you of that fact.</p>
        <p>0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business
        purpose, along with the category of any other company we shared it with.</p>
        <p>Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in
        a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be
        limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the

        information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal
        information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a
        transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies,
        without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any
        time.</span></p>
        <p>If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such
        transfers.</p>

        with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services
        which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances,
        we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.</p>
